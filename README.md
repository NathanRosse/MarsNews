I have not had a lot of time on this and I gotta step up now.

Ok this is, as Will said, very similar to the class examples from last week. Part 1 done and hopefully part 2 isn't that much harder

Thankfully part 2 was only marginally more difficult but it operated on previous examples. Big thanks to chatGPT for helping with my errors and the previous generations of people doing similar examples.
